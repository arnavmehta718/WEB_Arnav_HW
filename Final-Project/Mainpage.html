It was considred an key ingredient to the elixer of life. During the Song dynasty(960-1279) the practice of loose-leafs style was adopted as a way to preserve flavor, and a powdered version was also introduced. By the Yuan and Mind Dynasty. a for of pan-frying leaves was a practice to introduce more flavor within the system. Traditional tea was a laborious process.

		<p>Although Europeans first started importing tea in the 17th century, it appeared earlier in the West. Traders, missionaries and explorers traveling back and forth between Europe and the Orient became exposed to the budding tea traditions in China and Japan. Tea finally arrived in the West during the 16th century - a Portuguese missionary is attributed with bringing tea to Europe while caravanning back and forth between Portugal and China. Tea was not seriously traded though until Dutch merchants entered the picture. In 1610, the first shipments of Japanese and Chinese tea arrived in Europe via ships charted by the Dutch East India Company. Tea also flowed into Russia early on via camel trains that came from China on part of the famous Silk Road. The popularity of tea slowly spread across major cities, such as Amsterdam, Paris and London. Though high prices limited consumption. Initially tea was not adopted by the british. Unitl 1657 when tea was sold in shop, and consumption slowly rose. Tea cam to America through the Dutch trade, but was heavily taxed, and the Boston Tea Party was a protest to counter act the high taxes.</p>

		<p class="col-md-6" id="mepara1">A hot cup of coffee can perk you up in the morning. A soothing cup of tea can help you relax after a stressful day. Various studies have pointed to tea drinkers having lower odds of skin, breast, and prostate cancers. Coffee has a higher caffeine content than tea, meaning its levels of the stimulant might help people with asthma by relaxing the lung's airways. Caffeine also helps in constricting blood vessels in the brain and reducing migraines, and often alleviates hangovers because of this. Tea has often been considered a therapeutic or medicinal drink that has both soothing and rejuvenating qualities.</p>

	<div class="container3 col-md-6" id="aboutMe2">
		<p class="col-md-6" id="mepara2">As with anything that contains caffeine, way too much coffee and tea could result in increased anxiety, tachycardia, heart palpitations, insomnia, restlessness, and nausea. High amounts of unfiltered coffee, meanwhile, has been linked to higher levels of bad cholesterol, LDL. Tea contains fluoride, and while this is good for your dental health, too much of it may increase your risk of brittle bones and osteofluorosis. Certain tea blends from China, India, or Sri Lanka have been found to contain aluminum and risky amounts of lead, so where you get your tea is pretty important.</p>
