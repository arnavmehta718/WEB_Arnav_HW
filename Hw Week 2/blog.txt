wireframe reaction

the idea of wire framing is to get an idea of the layout or design of the project without
coding randomly. Using wireframes or sketching we can get to see a preview of what it would
look like and making changes on sketching is easier then fixing code. The first part of 
sketching is to figure out the problem and adress it. From there we can move onto solving 
that problem through wireframing. Wireframing also makes it easier to colaborate and get 
input from others before the heavy coding takes place.
